            through the best path for users inside the

            think of and ended with a card. My idea for

            <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>The whole time while working on Wireframes and Prototypes,
              I created a mood board which inspired colors, fonts and styles.
              I was drawn to bright colors that popped and felt young, and energetic.
              I especially picked up on the yellow block letters I was finding in
              news sites, and wanted to use that to some extent in the design.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I did many iterations of logos, and landed upon the shook logo
              where it looks like there may have been a printing error, or like
              the colors making up the logo are being shaken out.  The center oâ€™s
              are also reminiscent of shockwaves.</p>
