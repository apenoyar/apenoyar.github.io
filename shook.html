        <h2><span class="title">Summary</span></h2>
        <p>The world is stressful. People want to do something about it,
          but their lives are busy.  Shook is an iPhone app to make donations
          and contributions to nonprofits of political organizations easy,
          quick, and fun. </p>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>People are overwhelmed by negative news on a daily, hourly, and even minute to minute scale. And people want to do something about it.  But we are all so busy!   People want to donate easily to charities that support their values.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Shook!  When the world feels overwhelming, and you feel like we are about to enter into a nuclear war, all you have to do is shake your phone.  You get to donate small amounts of money on your own terms, donating to the causes that you care about most.</p>

                <p>The whole time while working on Wireframes and Prototypes,
              I created a mood board which inspired colors, fonts and styles.
              I was drawn to bright colors that popped and felt young, and energetic.
              I especially picked up on the yellow block letters I was finding in
              news sites, and wanted to use that to some extent in the design.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I did many iterations of logos, and landed upon the shook logo
              where it looks like there may have been a printing error, or like
              the colors making up the logo are being shaken out.  The center o’s
              are also reminiscent of shockwaves.</p>
