        <p>Hi! My name is Anna. I dedicated the first part of my career to service; in the Peace Corps, non-profits, and local government. Now, I'm taking the plunge, going back to school to learn to work at something else I'm passionate about... design. In the future, I hope to marry the two, using my design skills to help people.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As an only child, I spent much (<i class="info-one">maybe most?</i>) of my time at home entertaining myself, often times taking over the family computer.  In grade school, I played with Microsoft Paint for hours.  In middle school, I spent time   programming games onto my TI83+ calculator (<i>ok, I exaggerated, it was really Cosmo personality quizzes.</i>)  In high school, I made our Nordic Ski Team (<i>I’m from Vermont</i>) a webpage where my teammates could look up race and practice schedules.  It also played a midi version of “Ice, ice, baby” when it loaded.  I’ve always been drawn to both art and technology.</p>
        <p>In college, I studied Environmental Sciences.  I learned about trees, at one point knowing the scientific names and common names for the 75 most common trees and shrubs in the Northeast (<i>please don’t ask me to name any now</i>), and about the complex interactions that happen within an ecosystem, and how diversity keeps it strong. While I don't work in Environmental Sciences now, I still love to spend my free time outside, exploring, and being a very amateur photographer.</p>
        <p>I used my science-learning and to my parent’s mild horror, joined the Peace Corps!  During my first year in El Salvador, I really only spoke the most basic Spanish.  It was lonely, but thankfully on some Peace Corps packing list, someone suggested bringing Crayons.  I had, and that was how I was first able to connect with the children in my community: through art! Despite not knowing the words for things ideas, intentions, we were able to communicate.</p>
        <p>These days I spend my work life at a small public transit agency in Northern California, where I get to learn the mechanics of route design, and every now and then, I get to design the decals for a bus!</p>
